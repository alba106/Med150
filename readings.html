<h2>Reflections:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Reflection #1</li>
  <p>I generally use photography to capture daily life. Image making is not an arduous task anymore, so for me, it’s a simple as taking a picture from my phone. It may sound simple, but these are usually moments, memories, people, that at a certain point in my life I’ve been fond of or are endearing to me. Sometimes they tell stories, funny, sad, or happy. But it depends, since it is my perspective as the person taking them. On another note, images not ‘created’ by me make me perceive things much differently. Depending on the image, this story can be shaped and molded into whatever, just as author Sontag expresses, each image is an interpretation, not just a simple fact. Therefore, I could represent the notions of this world at this moment in time by contrasting the daily life moments, such as the ordinary life of people, interaction, and small events, with actual global issues like global warming, AI overtaking technology, and social inequality.</p>
<li>Reflection #2</li>
  <p>Nesrine Malik discusses the term “AI slop”. She claims this AI floods media, distorting perception and diffusing the urgency of the matter. She argues these images are not merely misinformation, but are also a visual ‘anesthetic’, making us skeptical of seeing truth at every turn. Ultimately undermining our capacity to act and distinguishing between fake and truth, a constant mistrust of any media. Malik also notes that the AI outputs are structurally biased towards whiteness and patriarchal norms which reinforce damaging narratives rather than fighting against them.</p>
  <p>By reading allowed to delve deeper into my understanding of what photomontage can be and is, through the use of masking, selection, and blending. On my own two pieces, I aimed to combine imagery with fragments of real textures, political signs, etc By blending modes like Overlay or Multiply, and let the real show through the ‘artificial’. My goal was to create contrast and disturb while delivering the message.</p>
<li>Reflection #3</li>
  <p>In the Graphic Novel of Motherhood in Crisis by Laurence Ivil, Alicia Prager, and Saidu Bah, the story “Tetteh: The Prisoner, ‘My Punishment’” uses illustration alongside text, photography, and video to tell the experience of a woman imprisoned after childbirth. The use of these illustrations in the story adds something that words or photos alone could not fully express. Through drawing, the artists show Tetteh’s emotions, memories, and trauma in a much more personal way. Illustration allows the story to go beyond the facts and capture more, like how the situation actually felt, not just how it looked or sounded. Visually, I believe illustrations are very different from photographs. Photos show real people, real places, and reality in a way that is almost physical; photos show this physical side of a story. So I think the use of photographs as well as illustration would have made the reader more vividly aware of the harsh and realistic conditions Tetteh faced. The illustrations used, however, use a blend of what’s real and imaginary, successfully going deeper into her inner world. Through color, lighting, contrast, and expression, the drawings communicate the fear, isolation, and pain through every experience of Tetteh. For example, where a photo could show a prison cell, the illustration exaggerates the darkness and space to represent how trapped, hopeless, and isolated she felt. Still, illustrations manage to mix reality with emotion by creating a visual portrayal of language that can go beyond what’s real, which photography can’t always achieve.</p>
  <p>Illustration also provides an ethical and emotional advantage in stories like this. Photos can sometimes be too revealing or even harmful to the people being represented, especially in sensitive situations like imprisonment or trauma, when the context is lacking or becomes twisted. Illustrations allow privacy and protection while still showing emotion and telling the story at hand in a close and heartfelt way. The artist chooses how to represent the subject and transmit the message, keeping the story powerful but respectful, which helps the viewer connect with Tetteh’s story without turning her suffering into something too exposed or even exploited. Compared to text alone, illustrations make the story easier to read and connect with on a visual and emotional level. Words can describe experiences, but drawings can make them instantly felt, the sentiment easy to understand. The mix of text and illustration creates a fuller, more layered story, one that can appeal to empathy and direction. Together with the photography and video at the end of the story, the illustrations turn Tetteh’s story into something real rather than a passing tale, helping the viewer understand that her experiences weren’t just factual and events that took place, but were deeply raw and human. Overall, these illustrations play an important role in “Tetteh: The Prisoner ‘My Punishment’.” They give emotional depth to the narrative and show what cannot be easily photographed or written. This way of combining art and journalism makes the story become more than just a report or article, but a reflection on ‘motherhood’, loss, and survival. The use of illustration turns Tetteh’s personal experience into something that speaks to everyone about strength, injustice, and the resilience of women and mothers facing unimaginable circumstances every day.</p>
