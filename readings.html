<ul>
<li>Reflection #1</li>
  <p>I generally use photography to capture daily life. Image making is not an arduous task anymore, so for me, it’s a simple as taking a picture from my phone. It may sound simple, but these are usually moments, memories, people, that at a certain point in my life I’ve been fond of or are endearing to me. Sometimes they tell stories, funny, sad, or happy. But it depends, since it is my perspective as the person taking them. On another note, images not ‘created’ by me make me perceive things much differently. Depending on the image, this story can be shaped and molded into whatever, just as author Sontag expresses, each image is an interpretation, not just a simple fact. Therefore, I could represent the notions of this world at this moment in time by contrasting the daily life moments, such as the ordinary life of people, interaction, and small events, with actual global issues like global warming, AI overtaking technology, and social inequality.</p>
<li>Reflection #2</li>
  <p>Nesrine Malik discusses the term “AI slop”. She claims this AI floods media, distorting perception and diffusing the urgency of the matter. She argues these images are not merely misinformation, but are also a visual ‘anesthetic’, making us skeptical of seeing truth at every turn. Ultimately undermining our capacity to act and distinguishing between fake and truth, a constant mistrust of any media. Malik also notes that the AI outputs are structurally biased towards whiteness and patriarchal norms which reinforce damaging narratives rather than fighting against them.</p>
  <p>By reading allowed to delve deeper into my understanding of what photomontage can be and is, through the use of masking, selection, and blending. On my own two pieces, I aimed to combine imagery with fragments of real textures, political signs, etc By blending modes like Overlay or Multiply, and let the real show through the ‘artificial’. My goal was to create contrast and disturb while delivering the message.</p>
