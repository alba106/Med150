<p>Art is a form of expression, it grants me the power to show and tell what my concious struggles to deliver. Not only that but it expands one's mind with its complexicity and develops character. For example, music. Music has so much levels to it, and you can rasonate with one or all with no shame. Such as its lyrics, giving new vocabulary and building stories, or a rythm that could make you cry, or dance all at the same time.</p>
