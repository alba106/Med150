<p>Art is a form of expression; it grants me the power to show and tell what my conscience struggles to deliver. In this class, I hope to create a form of visual art that can accomplish this goal. I am especially interested in animation, just as I enjoy watching it. Must admit that I do find it a challenge and something I should spend more time on so I can improve. On a different note, another media form I truly enjoy, and would certainly not live without, would be music. Music has so many levels to it, and it's so easy to resonate with it, whether it's the beat you feel, the lyrics, the instruments, or the rhythms. In my case, I love the songs that tell a story and the voices that provoke emotion. Overall, music is just wonderful. Therefore, I expect this course to be as entertaining as I find these forms of media. I wish to learn more about these hobbies of mine and delve deeper into the other types of media while also getting to know the people, be part of a community with similar interests, and who support each other in the process.</p>
